# TSA Webmaster Project
This was a project developed by my friends and I for the Technology Student Association regional & state competitions. We competed against dozens of different teams, placing 4th out of 24+ at the state conference two years in a row. The code found for our project is all front end, with no backend implementation, and was deployed on Vercel for ease of use.
